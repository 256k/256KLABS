    <h1>Depth Year 2022</h1>
    <h2>Goals and expectations</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Brainstorm:</h3>
    <p>date: 2021-12-18</p>
    <p>
        we are nearing the end of the year. 2021. I've decided to set a starting date for "depth Year 2022" on the 24th of December. There are multiple reasons why I've chosen to do this: <br/>
        a. in order to have a fixed date. <br/>
        b. in order to start depth year during my holiday vacation. giving the starting week a headstart and having less pressure from work. <br/>
        c. in order to focus on the holidays and spend some quality time with my family. <br/>
        <br/>
        Afterall, part of "depth Year 2022" is about balancing my family time with my nerd time. something I find quite difficult as I let myself go to my obsessive tendencies. I end up binging all my time focused on these various endavours and obsession over gear and new things while simultaneously not really accomplishing anything substantial. 
        <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        In this preparatory document, I want to start organizing my thoughts and my goals. set a clear plan of action focused on achieveing a set of goals I have chosen for the year. Goals relating to my hobbies, my family, my lifestyle and my day work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It's no surprise that since my father's passing I've stuggled to focus on anything constructive. I feel I'm not the same, my brain doesn't function the same as it once did. High sensitivity to anxiety and a dwindling attention span, these are the things I'm hoping to overcome as a byproduct of this year's goals and the road towards them.
    </p>

    <h3>Complete list of goals and aspirations:</h3>
    <p>This will serve as a collection of all the goals and aspirations i'd like to achieve, whether this year or in general. A braindump if you will of issues I'd like to work on in no particular order other than what comes to my mind first.</p>
    <p>these goals have a tendency to be vague and difficult to quantify. often this is a cause of failure for these sorts of lists or plans, so i'll try my best to create very targeted and quantifiable goals in order to be able to compare at the end of the year if i've achieved them or not.</p>

    <p>I'm going to be dividing these gooal into categories in order to give them some sort of structure and also help organize my own thoughts and see how many "sections" of my life do these points traverse.</p>
