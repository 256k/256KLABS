        i dont got much to say really things have been ok. my gas has severely reduced although i do find myself in frantic "buy" mode sometimes but thankfully i never actually click the button and then later on i realize the stupidity of my ways and i'm happy i didn't click. although something hard to get used to is the g uilt. like when you think about it i'm not buying much right now, just some basic shit. but in my mind, there are all of these scenarios where i buy this and buy that, and somehow my mind takes that as reality and starts to guit trip me about it. i guess this still will take time to adjust and stablize.

        i've gotten back into photography these days, i dont know exactly what re-triggered it. but kinda fell back into that hole. which is fun! i do enjoy photography very much and it's not as GAS intensive as other hobbies, although this time around i was thinking about film and the difficulties with it from buying it at the crazy high prices to all the development and scanning and printing if even one prints anything, most of my film stays in negative shape and only ever gets scanned. so apart from the look of film, what really do i gain as a analog medium? why pay so much more money to have digital photos that are worse than digital SLR photos?

        I kid but that's kinda true. i figured what i love about film photography is the actual shooting because it's the one analog/physical part of it. which made me realize that instant photography takes care of all those problems. you get to shoot some film with all the analog-ness that comes with it and in the end you end up with an actual physical object that represents that instant moment in your life. and there a can not be 2 copies of it. so it's really a magical and unique meidum.

        I've decided to focus on instant photography rather than film because i know that with film i'll shoot a bunch of rolls and never actually get them developped. instant while flawed in some ways (both the film itself and the hardware) can be it's own creative platform. initially i was hoping to find a camera that did instant (polaroid or instax) that could g ive me the same satisfaction of using a mechanical SLR or a medium format camera, but in the end that's not the point of polaroid, the point is that it's somewhat flawed.and instant. people do amazing work with point and shoots and people do shit wrk with the latest DSLRs. i keep trying to get technical stuff but i have nothing to prove this is about having fun.

        I will be including a photo gallery on my site that will expose both polaroids and film photos that i've taken throughout the years. as well as expose new work coming in the future.
