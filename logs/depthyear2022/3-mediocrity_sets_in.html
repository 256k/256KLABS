    <h2>Mediocrity sets in</h2>

		is this what a midlife crisis feels like? am i in the beginning or am i at the end?
		It has become quite evident of how mediocre i am at everything i do. My dreams of success and acknowledgement have faded into nothingness. my young man who believed with all his heart taht he was destined to a special life is dead. 
		<br/>
		I have proceeded to shut myself off entirely from the internet, or more specifically, social media and all social interactions. I have come to finally accept that i am nothing more than a boring grunt who works a boring job and lives a boring life and will probably end up dying prematurely due to cancer if the world doesn't somehow end before that due to climate crisis. i truly and wholeheartedly believe this. 

		i might still work on stuff, i might not. i have no idea. i have zero motivation. zero aspirations anymore. i am nothing. i am worthless. i deserve nothing. life has broken me. 
		<br/>

		I don't understand anything anymore. why do i just slide by as if i am a ghost? why do others receive the success and admirations for their creative projects and yet somehow anything i do doesn't eve register in the world. regardless of the answer, i will never know it. and i have come to accept it. now i am nothing more than average. an insignificant pixel in the screen of life.

		it hurts.................
