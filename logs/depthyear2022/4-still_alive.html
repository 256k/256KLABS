        The last couple of days have been really rough on me mentally. felt like i was really hitting a hard depression level. In anger i took the decision to disable my discord account and block most of my social media websites.
        This was the best decision i never took.

        already 2 days after the fact, and i feel better. of course this is not only related to that. but the fact i don't have this constant stream of gear being bought and sold and the amazing work of so many creative people doing what i dream of doing makes it easy for me to stop comparing myself and really focus back on my own life and my experiences isolated from any unhealthy comparisons. 

        I often have the reflex of opening discord but remind myself that my account is suspended. i'm very grateful that they have this feature that way i can really be sure i wont slip up. 

        last night i wrote another simple arduino script for a 8 potentiometer midi controller that will be made to be mounted inside a small pedal enclosure. for now it will be usb only. 
        I have to remind myself that making stuff should be first and foremost for me and that i shouldn't put so much importance or even though on having it be a sellable item or try to put everything and the kitchen sink. 

        the whole idea is to make stuff for fun and for education and for making music. the calm that the social media blackout has given me already feels very healthy. 

        I do believe that I will eventually go towards a more retreated presence online and only communicate through my website and just have it be shared on something like twitter.

        twitter still feels like the least hostile place for me actually, i know that most people hate it but personally i don't have many followers nor am i following many people. so it's mostly just a platform for me to share things for anyone interested without much interaction. i still have it blocked but i do take some quick peaks from time to time by disabling the blocker for 10 minute inervals.

        on another note, We received our exercise bike yesterday. this is great news. i'm excited to start my new healthier daily routine. it'll be difficult to get it rolling smoothly at the beginning but i definitely am exited to introduce new better habits in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
        I hope that this positive outlook will stay. I was taking too much care and putting too much importance on competing with others and on trying to get approval of others. I don't and shouldn't care what others think. I should do my own thing.
        I have a good life overall. in the grand scheme of life and the universe, i was dealt a very good card, for this i am eternally grateful. since my father's passing, sadness and depression has had a backdoor entry into my brain where at any point, triggered by the most mundane event, it'll pounce and take over my thoughts. I should always keep an eye on my blessings and appreciate what i have and remember that the people that i was trying so hard to impress might be better than me in certain things, but surely are not in other things. and it might not be flashy things but it's things that do count in the end. social media is filled with people putting their best work forward without much exposure over the process or the failures.

        another difficult weakness i'm slowly trying to overcome is the compulsive shopping disorder i have. otherwise known as G.A.S. in the hobby community. gear aquisition syndrome. people make light of it and i guess it's much like any other syndrome or addiction, not everyone is susepteble to it. I seem to be very weak and have been for years now. I am truly ashamed at the amount of gear and stuff i have bought over the years and to think where i could've been financially if i didn't waste my time all this time buying and selling things. but it is what it is. looking back is only useful to learn lessons not to wallow in regret. i need to look forward. it'll take time to go back to a financially healthy state, but I have to persevere.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've notived this pattern of binge buying stuff to the point where i start to freak out on how much stuff i bought, get depressed, start to feel like i need to purge gear to feel better about myself. sell stuff at a loss, don't fully over my debts. start to feel better again, and get the desire to have gear again and then loop. this happens either in a single hobby or across multiple hobbies, selling one hobby's gear to buy another one's or vice versa. 
        <br>
        <br>
        this time around I've decided to not binge sell like i always do. I am going to hold onto my gear. all the gear i have right now. this is the gear i have. I will just vut my losses and start counting from today. 
        instead of trying to get a couple of grands from my gear and then regret it later, i'll just stop any and all purchasing today and only start paying off my debts starting today. that way when i have the envy to play with gear again, i'll already have it ready so i won't have to buy more stuff. I have a lot of gear. and i can really go from one to another and have so many diff fields to explore (which was the whole point of depthyear) without having to buy more stuff.

        yes my gear is expensive, but it's also not in the grand scheme of things, the problem is that i don't really take into consideration the value that it brings me and its value over years and years but that is only because i never hold onto gear for a long time. an op-1 is an expensive keyboard, but spread over 10 years it really isn't at all. and it's clear that the op-1 will last over 10 years from its construction. and this is just 1 example. 

        this is the mentality that i need to have going forward. 
        <ul>
            <li>Keep all the gear i have.</li>
            <li>stop buying any more gear</li>
            <li>focus on paying my debts from now</li>
            <li>whenever i have a desire to explore something whether DIY or music or code, i have something to explore it with.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        anyways. I really hope this is the start of a healthier lifestyle. I really feel bad in so many aspects of my life, first and foremost in my own body. I feel fat. i feel heavy. i feel dumb. i feel tired. i feel old. for a 35 year old, this is unacceptable. i've shyed away from gyms and exercise and all that lifestyle because growing up, any and everyone who was into that lifestyle was a complete douchebag, and i did not relate or identify with them. I've always identified with the artist identification and in my brain an artist was someone who stayed up late doing things, getting high, eating bad and just comptely lost in their obsessions. and this is in some ways true, but this is not sustainable, and if you really look at any successful artist (not some hungry artist living in a shithole) an artist taht has a nice life and a healthy balance, you'll find that good food and exercise is at the core of their life. this should be the core of every human's life. this is extremely evident to me now especially after moving to montreal and seeing how people are a lot more healthy here because they have a lot more activities and put a lot more importance on exercise and healthy lifestyles. i really hope the exercise bike will be the catalyst towards that lifestyle.
