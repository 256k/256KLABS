    <h1>Depth Year 2022</h1>
    <h2>Reflections after 1 month in</h2>
    <hr>

    <hr/>
    <p>
        the goals set hae proved to be more challenging than expected. I've pretty much broken every goal and "resolution" set  for this year already. But i'm not going to let that affect me negatively. i can't deny the past month has not been very easy on me. 
        between the lousy job i have now, my attention span (or lack thereof) my daily weed consumption and my obsessions with music gear, things have been difficult mentally. the past couple of days i've been doing a lot of reflections and readjusting my goals and aspirations for this year.
        i realized that my focus was misplaced. Instead of working on fundemental changes in my life that would lay the foundation for better decisions and goals in the future, I've picked short sighted and egotistic aspirations that are fuled by the very tendencies that i wanted to get rid of.
        I have to accept the reality of my life right now. accepting and acknowledging it is the first step in improving it. so, for this very reason i will try to put down on paper (html) the main weaknesses i'm currently facing.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>addiction to weed and self medication</li>
        <li>financial stupidity and short sightedness with money</li>
        <li>unhealthy lifestyle (late night youtube and munchies (due to weed), no exercising, mental weaknes and fatigue)</li>
        <li>unhealthy relationship with work and current code burnout</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        so clearly these are big issues that requier a substancial change in not only action but also perception.
        I've been at this same point many many times, these are not new themes, most of these are recurring themes that i never manage to competly get rid of.
        I will try this year to change my perspective and really shift the focus and importance from the trivial things like music and popularity towards constructive habits and sacrifices for the greater good
    </p>

    <p>I will try to name a few key rules / guidelines to follow </p>

    <ol>
        <li>financial stability and debt clearning is NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.</li>
        <li>physical and mental health are NUMBER TWO PRIORITY</li>
        <li>material objects are not important. </li>
        <li>sacrifice is the only way towards improvement</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>
        As i've said in the main points: Sacrifice is the keyword in all of this. I've been trying to ahve my cake and eat it too. there is no such thing. I have to accept that in order to get my life back in order, major sacrifices are required.
        a purge of gear will be difficult but will truly help in the long term. this is a really difficult subject as there are many things I have that would be difficult to replace again, judgement calls need to be taken.
        another thing i should keep in mind is, even if i don't sell a shit ton of stuff right now. at least store it away out of sight out of mind. i don't use most of it anyways so why have it hanging around? it'll only increase my mental fatigue.
        the real focal point in all of this and i do believe a big cause of stress in my life and in my SO's life as well is the debt we have accumulated. I have no been true to myself or to her. GAS is truly an addiction that i feel physically.
        I have to detox from it just as i have cigarettes.
        <br/>
        NO MORE EURORACK!
        Stop thinking you can make a lot of money from it. you'll end up spending so much more money and barely selling a few modules.
        there are no more get rich quick schemes. it's over.
        the main focus is your work. your job. coding. CODING IS THE FOCUS POINT! find ways to get out of your coding fatigue. I believe that with healthy changes in daily routine my mind will get better and clearer.
    </p>

    <p>
        so in resume, the goals right now for 2022 are as follows:
        <ol>
            <li>pay off your debts. stop expecting to spend money to make money. the only way to really make money right now is your job. stop spending mohey on gear and pay off your debts.</li>
            <li>force a change in your perception of coding and of your job. fall out of the gear/music rabbit hole and fall back into the coding rabbit hole. use norns & similar *preexisting gear* to help motivate coding love again</li>
            <li>do daily meditation and stretching in the mornning, go to bed early. read more books and mangas instead of watching youtube all the time.</li>
            <li>set aside if possible, HIDE most of your gear in order to keep the focus on coding instead of gear.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
