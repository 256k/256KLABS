    <p>Today is Day 3 of my Egyptian visit with my mom. Man was it a rough start.<br/>
		I don't want to babble on too long because i feel like there are many things id like to say but i'll try to keep it more brief this time and focus on the more important points. <br/>
		I've been feeling quite burnt out ever since my father's passing of course and felt like everything with me was miscalirbrated and out of wack. Having a hard time focusing on work and living unhealthy routines and not spending enough time with marie and just overall having a negative outlook/attitude on life in general.<br/>
		already 3 days in and i feel that it has done me much good. even though I am still suffering from jetlag and also the huge elephant in the room which is my dad not being here anymore and everything related to that but to be honest, i feel so exhausted by the idea of eadling with those emotions that i'm just trying to mentally avoid them at all costs. it's probaly not the healthiest thing to do but for now it's what i'm able to do so i can at least try to get something good happening here. <br/>
		on the plus side, i do feel like already the lack of chores and responsibilities is making me relax in a way i wasn't able to back home. I spent the last 3 days basically sitting in the balcony with the nice weather staring at the trees and traffic outside. my brain needs to reset, needs to unload all the stresses and anxieties it had held onto for such a long time. spending some of that time writing music and exploring my new music gear and setting very optimistic goals for them and i will most likely not realize haha.<br/>
		i told myself i would write a full album while on this trip, but it's becoming extremely obvious to me right now that this is a ludicrous proposition, however the idea of the album itself is not bad. i set about a set of rules and guidelines and context for that album that i do feel will help me stay focused on the task and not make me just run after morea gear instead to try and fill a quick void. <br/>
		even the G.A.S. (Gear aquisition syndrome) has subsided tremendiously, which is clear to me that it was simply a side effect of my depression and anxiety. I also am realizing the need I have to see a psychiatrist or similar professional because i'm clearly dealing with things I am unable to process myself. I hve a lot of conflicting thoughts and ideas that i need to say out loud and have someone help me go through them and unfortunately these are thigns i don't believe anyone i currently know in my life can help me with. but this is why this profession exists so why not. <br/>
	<br/>
	I truly hope that this trip will help me get better and put me back in a mental state able to cope with regular life and it's trials and challenges. I need to take charge of my life again but so far i've felt so burnt out I don't feel i am able to take charge of anything at all and i've become very very passive. but i'm already starting to feel a slight change and i hope it'll keep getting better and better and that i'll be able to come back from all of this stronger and better than i was before i left.
	<br/>
	until next time.
