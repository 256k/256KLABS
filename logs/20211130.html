<h1>20211130</h1>

<p>2021 coming to a close. What a year it's been. struggling to get back into a healthy lifestyle, my brain feels like it's constantly racing towards something i don't know what. i keep putting this face of happiness and enthusiasm but it's all fake. that's just how i am. inside things are not great. music this year has been a very bizarre space to explore, i've had ups ad downs i've never had before, to the point where i swore off all electronic music entirely and decided to getinto cars and sim racing for a while then back into playing guitar still swearing off electronic music, to somehow ending back into electronic music but through a path i haven't considered for years and years. 
<br/>
i remember back in around 2008 how imfatuated i was with the monome. it was such a beautiful and unique piece of gear at a time where most people would either use big heavy synths or a mouse and keyboard for music making. the idea of using a "controller" to extend the functionality of a computer was still a novel idea, especially in that 8x8 grid formfactor. 
<br/>

the monome was so far away from my means both financially and physically. being still a student in egypt, there was no way in hell i could afford or even just aquire a monome. even the arduino based group buys happening at the time on the old monome forums were too expensive because of the shipping. 
<br/>

eventually i decided to close the book on that world and moved on to discover chiptune music on the gameboy and things kinda evolved from there. but i never forgot about it. id still go to youtube and listen to old monome demo videos and still listen to some awesome monome artists. given how unique that machine was as well as its platform (maxMSP at the time) the functionality that it could provide was unique to say the least and carried out its own signature sound and feel. i don't know how much of it was the max scripts influencing the artists, or the artists influencing the max scripts they made. but i guess it was a mix of both. 
<br/>

long story short, for some reason i decided this year to get back into that world. partially because of my desire to escape current reality, trying to seek a feeling of calm and peace and happiness i once had. a time i've associated to that early monome time. and i've become obsessed ever since. i've made a few big ticket purchases that i'm not very proud of, then again i'm never really proud of the stuff i buy, i clearly have a problem with GAS, but nontheless, i have a grid 128 coming, as well as a norns shield and possibly today, in a latest installment if stupid financial decisions, i'll be buying a used monome 64 from the 2007-2010 era editions. (the one with the nice walnut case, orange LEDs and the tilt functionality). i know that they aren't as supported as the modern 128 grid on norns, that the 128 is clearly a superior device and that i'll probably not even use it that much but agian, i seem to be knee deep in this nostalgic spending phase so i must have it.
<br/>

a friend the other day shared with me an article talking about this imaginary tradition as he called it. "The Depth Year". the idea is quite simple, dedicate a year to focusing on whatever you have in front of you. take on nothing new, buy nothing new, learn nothing new. really delve deep into the stuff you have going on right now. "go deep not wide" to which my first reaction was to describe myself as: "as wide as an ocean but as deep as a puddle" so let's just say that it resonated with me a lot. I already taken the decision to reduce my purcahsing and hardware stuff in 2022, focus more on coding and exploring that side of things, given the norns will surely be a deep well of exploration, but with this article really focusing on this idea, i've decided on doing a proper depth year for 2022. I really wish i could get rid of this GAS/shopping addiction that i have, even if it's in the niche world of music gear, it's a shopping addiction never the less, let's not kid ourselves, and it's a very unhealthy way to spend both your money and your time. 

<br/>

so that's the plan: 2022 - Depth year. let's be honest, i'll definitely not run out of things to do with all the crap i have around me and all the hobbies i'm already involved in. perhaps this year will be a year of positive reconstruction of myself and my mental state. lord knows i need that. I don't know how to convey that need into words. all i know is that i feel really shitty all the time and my mind is a cloudy mess and i feel like my life is out of control while just pretending everything is okay. I hate this feeling of lying to people around me but i also feel like i don't deserve to say anything, to be in a bad place. it's weird i dont know how to explain it. I wish i could go away somewhere detached from the entire world for a few months. not talk to anyone or see anyone. i like to think id be very creative in that time and come up with a lot of interesting things and nice music but who knows, maybe id end up high and/or drunk the entire time. but we all know life doesn't stop and wait for you, you gotta just try to pick up the pieces as fast as possible while running and never stop.
