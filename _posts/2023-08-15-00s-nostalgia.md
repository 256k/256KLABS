I miss the old monome website and community
I miss the optimism and the feeling of a better future ahead of us
I miss the sounds of sine wave music and the happy melodies of the postal service
I miss the glossy white electronics and the isomorphic UIs of the mac OSX
I miss the simplicity of life


I miss my dad.
