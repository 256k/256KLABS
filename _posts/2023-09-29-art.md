You will never like your own art. By the time you are finished, it's already obsolete to you.
As artists what we truly seek is not the end product, but the experience of creating something. We cannot goon in life without the act of creation. 
It is anintrinsic drice that we all have within us, a drive that forces us to create regardless of whether the end result is good or bad. We can't help it. It's more powerful than us. 

We must create, or else we die.
