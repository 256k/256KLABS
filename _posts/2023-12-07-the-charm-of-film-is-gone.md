I started shooting photos in very early 2000s, had a nikon FM as my first (and mostly only) camera and I loved how it felt in hand and the shooting experience. when DSLRs started getting affordable, I bought a nikon D40 to experiment with it and while it was nice having the photos immediately visible as I was doing a lot of skateboarding photography at the time and testing out lighting setups and having many takes was quite rough doing it in film, the photos felt unsatisfying and I ended up selling the D40 and going back to shooting film for my normal casual life documenting photography.
it was a easy decision given that film at the time was pretty much obsolete and while there was still stock being sold, no one was buying them so buying and developing film was quite cheap. sadly, as you all know this is no longer the case.

Flash forward to 2 years ago, still shooting film exclusively (sometimes i'll use my wife's old DSLR for certain shots) my film camera collection has increased now to include a nikon FE, a bronica 6x6 and a leica M2, the latter completely changed my way of shooting and it's become the body I exclusively shoot with. 

I used to love the look of film, I would lament the coldness of digital photos, but prices started to get really high as this was the boom of film again and buying and developing rolls was becoming quite the costly matter. 

At this point I had started developing BW photos at home and doing the whole DSLR scanning thing and I have to admit, the experience, while novel for the home development, was quite the pain when it came to scanning the film and the results were never that good. Nor were they coming from the lab either. I assume I had to opt for the more expensive scans from the lab to get a better quality but the price was getting ridiculous. 

I decided on getting a small digital camera to complement my film shooting for those occasions where I knew it wasn't worth shooting a film frame, I decided on the ricoh GR3 and let me tell you, that camera has completely changed my view on digital photography. The hype around the ricoh GR line is real. believe me. this camera is insane for such a small body. absoultely freeing experience, it's small enough to fit in any pants pocket or jacket pocket and can be completely used one handed making it incredibly simple to grab shots and the quality truly rivals competitors that are 3x the price. The call it the poor man's leica Q and while in a sense that's a great way of putting it, id argue that it's even better because of how portable it is. 

The GR3 made me see how far digital sensors have come since that D40 experience. the dynamic range and sharpness that digital can give you now will beat any film you could ever shoot. 

Given the friction points of film now, between developing, scanning, costs, inferior quality, and editing process, it feels like the glass has shattered on film for me and I no longer see the imperfections are charming artistic touch but just as the inferior medium it really is. 

I never thought i'd say this, but film no longer interests me. perhaps it's a matter of age, or finances, or just patience, or perhaps bad photographic skills, i'm not a professional by any means, most my photos are potato, I don't aspire to be a professional nor do I expect to have exhibitions, I want to document my life and document the world from my point of view, do it in a way that is pleasurable to me without feeling either guilty about the bad photos I take, bored by the uninspiring tools I use, or overwhelmed by extra steps I need to take in order to view and share my photos with loved ones... and sadly, film no longer feels like it fits this equation.
