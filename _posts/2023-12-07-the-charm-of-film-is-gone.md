I started shooting photos in very early 2000s, had a nikon FM as my first (and mostly only) camera and I loved how it felt in hand and the shooting experience. when DSLRs started getting affordable, I bought a nikon D40 to experiment with it and while it was nice having the photos immediately visible as I was doing a lot of skateboarding photography at the time and testing out lighting setups and having many takes was quite rough doing it in film, the photos felt unsatisfying and I ended up selling the D40 and going back to shooting film for my normal casual life documenting photography.
it was a easy decision given that film at the time was pretty much obsolete and while there was still stock being sold, no one was buying them so buying and developing film was quite cheap. sadly, as you all know this is no longer the case.

Flash forward to 2 years ago, still shooting film exclusively (sometimes i'll use my wife's old DSLR for certain shots) my film camera collection has increased now to include a nikon FE, a bronica 6x6 and a leica M2, the latter completely changed my way of shooting and it's become the body I exclusively shoot with. 

I used to love the look of film, I would lament the coldness of digital photos, but prices started to get really high as this was the boom of film again and buying and developing rolls was becoming quite the costly matter. 

Given the friction points of film now, between developing, scanning, costs, inferior quality, and editing process, it feels like the glass has shattered on film for me and I no longer see the imperfections as a charming artistic touch but just as the less practical medium it really is. 

I never thought i'd say this, but film no longer interests me. perhaps it's a matter of age, or finances, or just patience, or perhaps bad photographic skills, i'm not a professional by any means, most my photos are bad, I don't aspire to be a professional nor do I expect to have exhibitions, I want to document my life and document the world from my point of view, do it in a way that is pleasurable to me without feeling either guilty about the bad photos I take, bored by the uninspiring tools I use, or overwhelmed by extra steps I need to take in order to view and share my photos with loved ones... and sadly, film no longer feels like it fits this equation.
