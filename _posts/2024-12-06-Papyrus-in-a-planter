### Papyrus in a planter

Papyrus in a planter, estranged from your native habitat, you survive. 
Acclimating to the weather, so far from the Nile.
The kindness of people around you nourishes you, and in turn, you bring them joy in their lives.

Papyrus in a planter, you grow, you bloom, sometimes you get hurt, but you persist.
Your leaves are slowly turning white.
Dry spells bring hardship, but you resist.

Standing tall, but inherently fragile, you blend in the scenery.
But anyone who lookswill see, unlike the rest, you are the papyrus in a planter.
