## Plan 9 notes and documentation.

<i>This is a living document that will evolve as my explorations into plan 9 move forward.</i>

### Documentation and help in plan 9
plan 9 intro
<pre><code>man intro</code></pre>

to look up the manual of a certain command:
<pre><code>man [cmd]</code></pre>

to search the manuals for something:
<pre><code>lookman [query]</code></pre>

## Startup settings

modifying user profile settings:
<pre><code>acme $home/lib/profile</code></pre>
a few default settings exist in the user's library folder named profile.
this is where the /bin bindings take place. 
if you want to make your compiled programs run globally,
put them in the local bin folder and bind your local $user/bin file to /bin
<pre><code>bind -a $home/bin /bin</code></pre>
(-a means additive. you add to whatever is already bound)



changing the rio window multiplexer starting script:
this file is an executable shell script. if creating a new one
you must give it exec permission afterwards.
<pre><code>
acme $home/lib/rc/riostart

-- or if not available --

cd $home/lib/rc/
touch riostart
chmod +x riostart
</code></pre>

if you want to add a window to riostart but not sure about the x,y,w,h values
you can open manually the windows you want and set them up how you want then use wloc to echo the currently opened windows with their coordinates and proc name
<pre><code>wloc</code></pre>
